0,B,"['wishes', 'proposals', 'warnings', 'instructions']","According to the text, at a graduation ceremony you'll most probably hear   _   given by the speaker.","One of the requirements of every graduation ceremony speaker is that they offer some advice. Well, get ready, here it comes.
Soon you will be leaving the company of those who think they have all the answers -your professors, instructors and counselors-and going out into what we like to call the real world. In time you will meet up with other people who think they have all the answers. These people are called bosses. My advice is: humor them.
A little later you'll meet additional people who think they have all the answers.
These are called spouses   . My advice is: humor them, too.
And of all goes well, in a few years you will meet still another group of people who think they have all the answers. These are called children. Humor them.
Life will go on, your children will grow up, go to school and someday they could be taking part in a graduation ceremony just like this one. And who knows, the speakers responsible for handing out good advice might be you. Halfway through your speech, the graduate sitting next to your daughter will lean over and ask, ""Who is that woman up there who thinks she has all the answers?""
Well, thanks to the reasonable advice you are hearing today and that I hope you will all pass on, she will be able to say, ""That is my mother. Humor her.""",high12130.txt
