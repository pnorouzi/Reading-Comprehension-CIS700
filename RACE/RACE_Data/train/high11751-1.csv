1,C,"['very excited.', 'very shocked', 'indifferent', 'very happy']",What' s the reaction of the residents at Yaxi to the award according the passage? They feel,"Cittaslow has discovered China, and it is awarding a little village in Jiangsu the title of ""slow city""
The bored teenagers of Gaochun are impatient with the leisurely pace of hometown life.For them there is no nightlife to speak of, no bright lights, no excitement and they cannot wait to grow up and leave for the urban attractions of the big cities.But it is this laid-back lifestyle that has attracted international attention.At least, a quiet village within Gaochun county has come under the spotlight.Yaxi village, population 20,000, is about to be designated China's first ""slow city"" by Cittaslow, the sustainable lifestyle movement that first surfaced in Italy 11 years ago.
At home, the residents at Yaxi are unfazed and pretty much unimpressed by the honor.To them, life has been like this for as long as they can remember.Here, growing old gracefully is natural.
Nobody living in this little county had heard of Cittaslow or the words ""slow city"" before this.
""The first time I heard the term was last July, when the vice-president of Cittaslow, Angelo Vassallo, visited Yaxi village,"" says Zuo Niansheng, the chief editor of local newspaper Gaochun Today.
""Vassallo was deeply impressed by this village's natural and cultural resources and said it perfectly fitted the requirements for a slow city,"" says Zuo.""That was how Yaxi became connected with Cittaslow.
The Slow City must also be committed to protect and maintain the natural environment as well as promote a sustainable way of development ?all of which are the current strategies adopted in Gaochun.""We've been doing this for years,"" adds Zuo.
Cittaslow was founded in Tuscany, Italy in 1999.It was a spin-off from the Slow Food movement which started, also in Italy, in 1986 as a protest against the first McDonald ' s opening near the Spanish Steps in Rome.The movement championed a return to healthy, nutritious home-grown, home -cooked food.
Slow Food has since expanded globally to more than 130 countries.Its mission has also broadened to include the promotion of sustainable foods and local small businesses, and the localization as opposed to globalization of food production.
Cittaslow is an expansion of the Slow Food movement, and it actively advocates a lifestyle that is sustainable, that will improve quality of life, and will preserve cultural and culinary  heritage.",high11751.txt
